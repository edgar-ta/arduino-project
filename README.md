This branch is intended to be the C++ version of the
project.

I had already created an implementation in C because
I thought the Arduino we were going to use didn't have
the capacities for using C++, turns out it does, and
I spent one hour or so writing names like `MotionEventListener_continueConnection`
trying to emulate classes in C.
